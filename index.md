# A
- Patrick J Muzaale earned a PhD at UC Berkeley in 1980 without a secondary school education
- He completed primary school
- Admitted to Busoga College Mwiri for a few terms
- Dropped out because Abimereki Dhatemwa, his dad, couldn't afford the fees
- Reed College somewhere not too far from Berkeley and a time not too far from 1980 comes to mind
- Thanks to an alternative pathway later in life, via Kikuyu Colllege, PJM made it to Makerere University
- Its his bachelors degree here in Economics (topped the class) that earned him a career-development scholarship to UC Berkeley

# B
- We do have some input
- Early sense of output
- Perhaps we can think metrics for PJMs throughput?
- Then perhaps question the value of a secondary school education to sufficiently motivated
